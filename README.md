# tjex.net

The repo for my personal website / blog, [tjex.net](https://tjex.net). 

It's using the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework and was extended from the 
[Astro Minimal Starter](https://github.com/littlesticks/astro-minimal-starter) template, using [pico css](https://picocss.com) 
as a base for styling.

As a note for anyone else interested in using the Astro Minimal Starter linked above; it was built before Astro collections were 
implemented! It's not too much of a pain to modify the template to make use of Collections. For guidance you can check the 
code of this repo, as I'm using Astro Collections.
