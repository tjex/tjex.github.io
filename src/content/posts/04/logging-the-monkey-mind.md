As of [yesterday](https://tjex.net/logs/04V01) I'm trialling a style of logging that sits somewhere between a
social media post and a diary. This will be taking place over at
[logs](https://tjex.net/logs).

Why? I'm putting effort into making this site more of an
[artefact](https://tjex.net/#this-site), rather than a digital business card and
accompanying blog to illustrate that I'm still alive. So in keeping with that
goal, logging a (filtered) [monkey mind](https://mntre.com/reform.html) could be
a value over time so that
(a) you, the reader, may stumble across some interesting links, ideas, notions or
comedy and (b) I, the monkey, have a record of my fleeting thoughts.

I think having this record online will maintain _some_ sense of thoughtfulness and
tact, and with the added side effect that I can also access them the
internet - as it does happen where I recall something cool I saw but am not on
my own machine to find the link in my history or
[bookmarks](https://github.com/sysid/bkmr).
