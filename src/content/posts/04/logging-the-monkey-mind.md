As of [yesterday](https://tjex.net/logs/04V01) I'm trialling a style of logging that sits somewhere between a
social media post and a diary. This will be taking place over at
[logs](https://tjex.net/logs).

Why? I keep a personal diary, and I also sometimes [post on
Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@tjex). But neither of those places are good for
the [monkey mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_mind).

I'm putting effort into making this site more of an
[artefact](https://tjex.net/#this-site), rather than a digital business
card and accompanying blog to illustrate that I'm still alive. So in keeping
with that goal, I think it's fitting to log on this site a (filtered) monkey
mind so that (a) you the reader may
stumble across some interesting links, ideas, notions or comedy and (b) I the
monkey have a record of my fleeting thoughts.

I think having this record online will maintain _some_ sense of thoughtfulness and
tact, and with the added side effect that I can also access them the
internet - as it does happen where I recall something cool I saw but am not on
my own machine to find the link in my history or
[bookmarks](https://github.com/sysid/bkmr).

...and (c) I really don't want to spam this stuff to the few people who follow
me on Mastodon, or may feel like doing so. They should get the double filtered
monkey mind at the very least.

I guess an RSS feed for the [logs](https://tjex.net/logs) would make sense as a
happy medium for this, like [Cory Doctorow's Daily Links](https://pluralistic.net/) - but
I'm not that important or interesting.
