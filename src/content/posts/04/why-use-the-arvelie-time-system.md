I've implemented the Arvelie time system, which I found documented [here on
Devine Lu Linvega's site](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/arvelie.html).

I wrote my initial thoughts on the time system in, [The Arvelie time system](https://tjex.net/posts/the-arvelie-time-system).

But why actually use it? Particularly, when I, unlike Devine do not live on a
boat and do need to exist much more rigidly within the dark ages of the Gregorian calendar.

For me it's for two main reasons.

1. Treating the beginning of a project as year 0 creates a closer relationship
   to the project.
2. This site is not a news site.

Additionally, Arvelie time offers a much cleaner framework for project planning
and time management. In the Gregorian calendar a "month" of work can be anywhere
between 28 to 31 days. A "month" in Arvelie is 14 days, always.

## A closer relationship to a project

This website is a personal project. Not just the source code, but the projects,
posts and artefacts that get presented on it. I am also a personal project
(WIP). 2020 was the year when my direction in life began to steer in a very
different direction (moving from a life in music to a life in software
development). 

> Strangely enough, before any of that was apparent, and before
> Covid-19 hit, I had started a physical journal mid 2019 and titled in Paradigm
> Shift. I later [released the music I was making at the
> time](https://tjex.bandcamp.com/track/paradigm-shift) under the same title.

By embedding the age of a project within time, time itself becomes a member of
the project, rather than its usual function -- a tool to categorize and sort all
historical and future events.

I developed that impression very quickly when browsing through Devine's website.
Seeing time stamps in Arvelie communicated the progression of the work
within the context of the Devine Lu Linvega / xxiivv project, rather than a
universal point in time.

A nice side effect is that the connotations of a timestamp is also removed. If I
see a timestamp somewhere in the range of 2020-2022 I think "Covid-19". On
Devine's site 2020-2022 would be represented as 14A00-16A00.

Sometimes that context can bolster the character of a work. But other times
it can hinder it. When browsing a blog for example, it's easy to go back a year
or two and begin to characterise the posts as "old", even though the topics may
be completely relevant or even _more_ relevant -- it's no secret that to see the
future, we need to look into the past.

Arvelie time allows for a less 'flavoured' interpretation of the artefact, and
brings Time on board as a project member, rather than a standard universal
measuring stick.

## This site is not a news site

The posts I've made so far may include some references to current
happenings, like [learning in the prehistoric age of AI](https://tjex.net/posts/prehistoric-ai-learning),
but I'm not reporting on events.

Because of this, regular dates are not nearly as important.

In any case, Arvelie time maps perfectly to the Gregorian calendar. It's just a
cleaner way to divide up spans of time. I built an [Arverlie
converter](https://git.sr.ht/~tjex/arvelie) that I use in all my blog and diary
templates. In my [logs](https://tjex.net/logs) I reveal the regular date if
you hover over the Arvelie time stamp on an individual log page, like the [log
page for today](https://tjex.net/logs/04V01).

Likewise, technical blog posts would not be suited for Arvelie time. People
need to know the date of a technical post to get an idea of how outdated the
tools now are.

Particularly in the web domain or when learning a new tool or language, things
move so fast that a technical tutorial a year or two old can land you with in a
sub-optimal or completely dated solution.
