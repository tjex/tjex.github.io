- listen to _good_ podcasts.
  - you will hear terminology in context.
  - you will get many good references for further research.
  - you will hear opinions to measure your own against.
  - it's a low cognitive effort task, which is good, as the rest is not...
- bookmark the blogs / references / sources that you like for learning
  programming related things and only refer to these. Don't start at the search
  engine every time.
- always be writing code.
- keep a wiki for terminology or language features as you learn them. It will
  become redundant quickly, as you progress, but writing it helps to learn it and
  it's an invaluable time saver when you do need to re-reference something.
- make your editor / IDE awesome. Spend some good time making your work
  environment (almost) exactly how you like it. Take pride in your
  spaceship. Make it a nice place to be. You'll spend a lot of time in there.
- decide on one very thorough computer science or programming book that takes
  you from basics to advanced topics, and stick with it. There is nothing worse
  than cherry picking through hard books, or starting multiple. Spend time on
  this decision before committing to one.
- become more comfortable with following text tutorials, rather than video
  tutorials. Video tutorials take a lot longer to get through as you can't scan
  through to skip over things you know or have heard 100 times already.
- recognise that the other skills you have developed before tech are an asset.
- recognise that what you are doing _is_ hard, and be proud that you're doing
  chipping away at it.
- keep a mini diary where you can write down little wins, or moments of
  frustration. Once you review your diary notes at some significant time in the
  past, and you can read and remember how you were back then, and know how you are
  today, you're set. There's no turning back. Trick is to be consistent with the
  diary and not force the moment to come when you review your entries.
- practice leetcode early and consistently. Do one algorithm a week until you
  need to pick up the pace, don't force yourself to finish it, keep it going and
  use it as a little game to refresh your mind at some point when you're
  frazzled from some other task.
- take time, and make the effort to understand as best you can _why_ something
  works or does not work. This is perhaps the most valuable point.
