It amazes me how much time and attention people give on forums to help others.
And it saddens me that this will likely disappear in the AI age. 

Like [this example on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42333350).

It's also immediately apparent to me how differently I evaluate the answer based
on the date. The answer was written in 2017. This was pre LLM's. It was written
by a human. It feels real, even in digital form.

In 10 years, I don't think this will be a regular feeling to have.
