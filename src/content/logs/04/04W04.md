The past three or four days as been spent back again in the Asahi linux world. 
It's nearing the tipping point for me. Bascially all programs I need are working
straight from `dnf` install. Signal isn't availble on aarch64, nor are any music
applications I would use (not that I'm making music at the moment anyway...). 

But damn... It's so nice to be back in this world. I missed rofi and having
nothing on the computer except what is absolutely necessary or put there by me.

So, question of the day is: will this time, really be the time I make the switch to Linux?
