Was in Charlottenburg today. We sat at an expensive cafe on a corner with
Kurfurstendamm. Three dudes spent the whole time driving up and down the street,
revving their engines and accelerating suddenly on green lights. More or less
coming back around every few blocks. Basically a circle jerk, at the expense of
everyone else's ear drums.

I observed the rest of the people sitting at our cafe and the neighbouring
restaurants. Everyone looked so bored, unhappy or engaged in some kind of
posturing conversation. 

What a vibe... Extensive wealth, but no soul.

My parter was talking to me about Animal Farm this morning. And just now, I log
on to Mastodon and see a post about Animal Farm. Funny how if it was Facebook or
Instagram, I would question once again if my devices really are listening to me. 

Goes to show how much damage shitty corporate behaviour can make on a user of
technology.
