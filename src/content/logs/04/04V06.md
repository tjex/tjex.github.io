Being a native English speaker, I naturally source my news, podcasts, blog
posts, etc in English. Now being in the tech industry, it's really caught me off
guard how much this world exists within the sphere of the USA.

I feel like any podcast I find is US, blog posts are people living in the US,
news is strongly rooted in the US, Reddit posts are all to do with the US. It's
a bit disorienting.

...

I love the [tetragrammaton podcast](https://www.tetragrammaton.com/podcasts),
but the [latest
episode](https://www.tetragrammaton.com/content/alfred-hitchcock) has got me
feeling frustrated and confused... It's an "unexpected" conversation with Alfred
Hitchcock, who is of course dead. In typical music / arts web design,
information is either hidden, ambiguous or non-existent.

There is no context about how this conversation was created. But it's presented
as if Rick was actually having a conversation with Hitchcock.

I don't think this is very cool.
