Being a native English speaker, I naturally source my news, podcasts, blog
posts, etc in English. Now being in the tech industry, it's really caught me off
guard how much this world exists within the sphere of the USA.

I feel like any podcast I find is US, blog posts are people living in the US,
news is strongly rooted in the US, Reddit posts are all to do with the US. It's
a bit disorienting.
