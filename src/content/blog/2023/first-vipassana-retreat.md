## Vipassana

Vipassana is the original, unaltered meditation technique of "The Buddha" (as we were
taught, any enlightened person is Buddha), Siddhartha Gautama. It is a practice
of meditation that is universal in that everyone has access to it. You don't
need to pay someone to provide you with your own special mantra (no access for
the poor), to visualise an image (no access for the blind), or to sit or move
in any particular way (no access for physically challenged). The technique is
grounded in experiencing the present moment through observation of bodily
sensations, something that everyone has access to [^1].

The following is my understanding of the philosophies of Vipassana meditation
and how they interface with our daily life and nature as a whole.
As context, you can read a text [here](https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/art) based on a
talk by [S.N Goenka](https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/goenka), who was a leader
in the teaching of Vipassana from 1969-2013. A base point for any further inquisition 
should be [dhamma.org](https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/vipassana).

I comment a little bit on the ten day course I completed in June 2023, but in
keeping with the correct way of introducing people to the course - I do not
want to influence too much or create too much of an image.

The TL;DR for the Vipassana course itself is that it was mentally and
physically challenging but invaluably educational and rewarding. The two
advices I would give is 1) anyone considering to undertake a course should
first establish at least a loose practice of mindfulness meditation and be comfortable
to sit on the ground with legs crossed. This is more so that you can take best
advantage of the unique experience and environment of a Vipassana course, and
not have to spend all your time battling physical discomfort. And 2) to just
wait until you feel like it's a good time to do it. There's no need to rush. It
will pay off much more if it's done when it wants to be done. In the meantime, 
further your meditation practice on your own accord.

## The Retreat

![dhamma sobhanna meditation retreat](/img/2023/dhamma-sobhana.jpg)

I did my course in Sweden at [Dhamma Sobhana](https://sobhana.dhamma.org/). The
environment was a manifestation of tranquility itself; well kept gardens, small
forest areas with varieties of beautiful flowers, winding paths and cosy red
cottages with white trim. Time is defined by the soft striking of two
gongs. One for the male students, another for the female, a perfect fourth
interval apart, creating a slowly phasing ambient rhythm that is heard anywhere
in the compound. Beds are comfortable, food is wholesome and amenities just
fine. 

The noble silence was an interesting and special experience. On the arrival
day, you meet everyone and can get to know each other, then from 20:00 the
noble silence begins. The nine days that follow you may not talk or communicate
with other students in any way. No gesturing, writing or signalling. This helps
a lot with being able to stay in the meditational focus and frame of mind
required to make the meditation sessions more fluid. It also reduces the mental
friction that can occur if students compare their experiences with each other
throughout the week. This can lead to comparison between ones self and others,
which has no useful place in meditational practice at all. The meditation is
your experience. The yard stick is your equanimity. 

The most profound thing about the silence though is, upon the last day when the
silence is lifted, how much more you know each other despite not having talked
since day one. Everyone feels like close friends. This no doubt comes through
the sharing of the challenging experience, and living in close quarters with
each other. It was very interesting to experience how a strong sense of solidarity 
and friendship can still occur in near total lack of communication, vocal or otherwise. 

I considered a few times that it could be an interesting exercise for teams of 
software developers to spend some days (maybe not ten) in a retreat, where they cannot 
communicate with each other at all, but need to live together and also work on a programming 
task. The value would lie in the interpersonal and social developments that come from a form 
of interaction that is outside of the normal and mundane (like the uncomfortable exercise 
of two people being tasked to stare for two minutes directly into each others eyes without 
averting their gazes. Anyone who's done this, realises a strange sense of 'knowing' the person afterward, 
despite having exchanged no words). 

Vipassana retreats can be anywhere from three days to fourty-five. Ten days 
is the standard and recommended length. During these ten days, you essentially 
live the life of a monk or nun. You don't speak, you eat the food that is prepared 
for you and you follow a set schedule of meditation and break times. 

It's demanding, physically and mentally. Eleven hours meditation every day
requires the body to be accustomed to sitting on the floor without unbearable
or increasing discomfort. And to focus continuously for ten days is strenuous
in of itself, despite the focus not being on an analytical task. You do
encounter then, a form of mental exhaustion, and it's made worse when you
indulge in questioning how many days are left and how difficult will those days
increasingly be. But this is just as much part of the practice. To disengage
from those thoughts of aversion and craving, and the tension they bring, and to
return to the true reality of you being where you are, moment to moment.

## The Technique

On the forth day the main Vipassana technique, *Pa침침캐*, is taught. It's the
practice of observing sensations in the body and remaining equanimous with
them. This means to not judge them as being pleasurable or unpleasurable,
desirable or undesirable, wanted or unwanted. By practicing this equanimity,
the behavioural pattern of the mind, which seeks to generate craving (pleasure)
and aversion (displeasure), becomes weakened. The generation of craving or
aversion leads to attachment; we become attached to something desirable
happening, or something undesirable not happening. When the opposite happens,
and what we want to happen does not eventuate, we encounter misery. 

With this, Buddha concluded that craving and aversion are the root cause of all
misery and to become fully enlightened, one must rid themselves of all craving
and aversion. At this point, a lot of people get demotivated from the
philosophy. *Enlightenment is a path only for some*. The rest of us can move
somewhere along the path and stop at whatever point is sustainable. That is the
best collective result for society. It does not need to be all or nothing. All
or nothing doesn't help, something more than nothing does. You can still have
sex (even with yourself), or do \<insert naughty thing\>. The idea is to become a
*better* person, not to become Buddha. You can actually bake the cake and eat
it too in this case, you just wont assimilate into the universe.

Vipassana teaches that each and every reaction we elicit, mental or physical,
begins with a sensation in the body. The sensations in the body arise from the
unconscious mind, that is its domain; the autonomous faculties of mind and
matter. By training ourselves to calm our outer layer, the conscious mind, and
to maintain awareness of bodily sensations as they rise and pass away, we are
training an ability to integrate an awareness into our every day life. When we
subsequently find ourselves in any situation, and we have a good practice of
Vipassana established (being equanimous), we can become aware of a sensation in
the body as they occur. With the awareness of that sensation, we can then react
more wisely than we otherwise would, as our reactions otherwise would be just
that - reactions, not considerations. 

## Anicca, The Law of Impermanence

From this comes the emergence of a compassion for all life an all beings,
because all life, including ourselves, exists within the same universal law of
impermanence. All things change. Because all things change, all things are
impermanent, ultimate truth cannot exist in the generation of craving or
aversion. Craving *can* remain permanent, as can aversion. They feed themselves
and only grow more hungry. This is incongruous with the universal law of
impermanence. It places you on a divergent path to that of true nature, which
ultimately generates misery for you, as you are diverging yourself from nature.  

Generating craving or aversion (*sank캐hra*) is the process of desiring reality to
be something it is not. Vipassana teaches the practitioner to observe reality
as it is, which brings tranquility and peace to the experience of reality. This
does not mean that we can't desire things. Or that if we desire things or want
things to be different, that we will only generate misery. Of course in
essence, it does work this way and becomes clearer when you take the extreme as
an example: If you always desire a different reality than your own, then your
reality will be misery, because day after day, year after year it is not what
you want. This is a disease that plagues many people who are focussed on
generating wealth and power for the sake of wealth and power. It leads to never
being satisfied, because there is always more to be had. Drug addiction
works the same, it's just the object of the craving is different. 

We can still desire things, and to be excited about things eventuating. **The
measure of how much misery this brings to your life is how much tension you
experience waiting for the thing to eventuate and how equanimous you remain
when that desire does not eventuate.** If you experience no tension while
waiting for the thing to eventuate; meaning you are present in each moment up
until it eventuates or not, and if you do not react with frustration, anger,
disappointment or such when it does not eventuate; then you are living a life
closer to real peace and harmony. A life of equanimity. 

Pure Vipassana theory would say that you should also not experience elation or
euphoria when the thing *does* occur. On the outset, this does not sound
appropriate. However, feeling elation, euphoria or other such extreme
"positive" feelings, are the *result* of a craving being satisfied. If you were
to feel elation, euphoria or such feelings when the thing eventuates, you would
equally feel devastation, anger, resentment or such feelings if it did not
eventuate. With each action there is an equal and opposite reaction. 

## A Sense of Realism?

It is however important to remember that nature and life could not exist
without sankahra. Reproduction is fuelled by sankahra. Nature is perfect, but
also imperfect. It is cruel and kind. We can also not simply conclude that a
life completely void of sankahra which an enlightened person achieves, should
be hailed as the true destination of happiness and prosperity for all humans. If all
humans achieved this, we would stop reproducing. It would be an extinction
event. However, it would arguably be better for all other beings and plants
on earth if humans became extinct. Everything else suffers by our existence (except 
diseases). 

![agent smith virus](/img/2023/agent-smith-disease.gif)

The paradox here I suppose is that if all humans did become enlightened, no one
would have a problem with the human race becoming extinct within a generation,
as we would all be one with nature anyway. We would be totally and collectively
at peace with death and the ultimate truth of nature, meaning we would not be
compelled to reproduce - a partial process of immortalising ourselves by passing
fragments of ourselves down to our children. 

At this point it is theory. Just reading the concepts can never lead to an
accurate conclusion of its truth. It needs to be experienced itself. And this
comes full circle to the essence of the Vipassana technique being a universal
truth. It is a practice that is universally true for each and every human
being. The practice is to experience one's own reality as it is, not as one
wishes it to be. There is no exclusivity in the accessibility to this truth or
ultimately to enlightenment. It is universal, and nature is universal. No one
is more or less resultant from nature than anyone else. Anyone can experience
the benefits of Vipassana because everyone has universal access to the truth of
nature through the manifestation of sensations of the body.

As touched upon, this is different from other modifications of the technique
such as transcendental meditation, which requires the practitioner be given a
mantra; a special and supposedly unique word, which only a guru can give. The
provision of this mantra, carries the burden of secrecy whereby the
practitioner cannot reveal the mantra to anyone else, or else the mantra will
loose its essence. While using the mantra as a source of focus for meditation
does calm and focus the mind, it does not allow the practitioner to access the
pure truth of themselves and their place in nature. This is because they are
themselves generating an alternate reality for themselves by repeating a secret
word. This by definition is *not* a universal truth. If each practitioner of
transcendental meditation is given a unique word, then each practitioner is
experiencing a reality that is divergent from their true reality when they
meditate, the reality as it is, not as they (through repetition of mantra) wish
it to be. By diverging from nature in a meditational practice, one can never
truly access nature at its core. Only the surface, a calming of the mind and an
enhanced focus, will be reached.

all perception of sensations in the body, but did not find anything. Only partial loss in sensation.
