It's important to step back and get some perspective about your progress with any skill. 
And considering the mammoth idea of taking a career side step into programming, and my general high
expectations for myself; I thought to begin a post series titled *The Noob Chronicles*, where I look back
in time since the last chapter and review it. This is the first chapter and I'm *not* going back to birth...

## Music, Art and For Loops

It's been two years since I learnt want a for loop was (and still is from last I heard). Since then the ball
has been rolling with great joy, but cracks are appearing on it's surface. I heard quite early on that the
more you learn, the more you realise how much you don't know. 

I've never felt this more than with programming. 

In music and art, a lot of your technique, creativity and craft is hidden, in that the "source code" of a music
file or image output is not observable. There is often no reference material at all for the public to unpack
how you made that content. And often, there can also be no material for yourself to look back on (as in the
case of improvised music or setups using a modular synthesiser which no longer holds the same patch).

In programming, the technique and craft of others is chronically visible because of open-source development,
tutorials, APIs, etc. And as you start to learn, you start to understand parts of what you're looking at, but
become very much aware of how much you have no clue about. 

The difference here between arts and programming, is that the process of learning to program has much larger
gaps between moments of gratification. Or put otherwise, the hurdles are larger and further in between than
when making music and art. 

With music and art, it more often than not feels good all the time. Playing music in particular creates a
symbiosis between your body (playing the instrument), your mind (accessing your creativity, memories and
emotions) and your environment (hearing the result of body and mind, echoed into the room). Actually, this is
why it's very hard to be even a *good* singer. It takes *a lot* of training to listen to the *actual* sound
and pitch of your voice and to correct it, as apposed to hearing what you *think* your pitch is.

With programming, you are not given so much leeway. Usually things just don't work *at all*; Like opening your
mouth to sing and excrement just spraying out, bouncing off the wall and hitting the fan, further pulverising it
until your left standing dumbfounded in a brown haze.
