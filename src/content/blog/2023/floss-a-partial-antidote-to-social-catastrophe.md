## What is the problem?

Technology, and in particular software, moves fast, and increasingly so.
Software interfaces with our lives on so many levels, that it becomes
harder and harder to distinguish between what is software driven and
what is not. With such saturation and speed of growth, governments and
regulators have been at once swamped by the pervasiveness of software,
and due to arduous bureaucratic process and political polarisation,
condemned to moving slowly in regulating the industry. This, combined
with the allure of huge profits for the private technology sector, has
contributed to bringing forth a free-market technoliberalist environment
that promotes a "strong emphasis on the failures of regulation and
government, and an effort to focus on private sector solutions to social
problems", ([Benkler](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4956/chapter/1879816/From-Utopia-to-Practice-and-Back)). This is in keeping with the
basic understanding of neoliberalism, but what characterises
technoliberalism is the "belief that adding more technology will
eliminate scarcity and deliver prosperity for all". But has technology
delivered these promises, or will it?

This essay argues that it could, but definitely not if we keep going the
way we have been. It focuses on the state we are currently in, where we
have largely lost our freedoms and agency as users of technology and how
this has harmed us as a community of communities (the public). It
discusses some of the reasons why this has happened, but in particular
how this has in part been enabled by the dominance of corporate
philosophies and tactics over those of an alternative model known as
Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS).

## What is FLOSS?

Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) is the combination of two
longer standing terminologies. "Free software" was coined by Richard
Stallman in the early 80s after the initial hacker culture of MIT
splintered, some departing to the path of proprietary (closed source)
software ([src](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262542289/coding-democracy/)). The term "free software"
however has led to a confusion of meaning that is still ongoing to this
day leading people to interpret the term to mean software that doesn't
cost money to use. Stallman aims to clear up the confusion as such,

> "When we call software 'free', we mean that it respects the users'
> essential freedoms: the freedom to run it, to study and change it, and
> to redistribute copies with or without changes. This is a matter of
> freedom, not price, so think of 'free speech', not 'free beer'." -
> [Richard Stallman](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html)

"Open source" on the other hand stands for criteria a littler looser
than free software. Like free software, the source code still needs to
be available for any who wish to inspect it, but where it departs is the
restrictiveness of some open source licenses and the divergent
philosophy this brings to the production of software ([src](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262542289/coding-democracy/)).

FLOSS appends "Libre" (French and Spanish for "free" in the sense of
freedom) to the "free software" idiom in order to make clearer the
true meaning of the philosophy. It therefore offers a neutrality between
the two.

## What is the common alternative to FLOSS?

The success of any corporation against its competitors can often rest
significantly on the strength of secrecy behind trade secrets. The
recipe behind Coca-cola is an endearing example, as is the formula for
the WD-40 multi-use lubricant and the algorithms behind Google search or
song recommendations on Spotify.

With trade secrets, companies exert competitive advantage on each other
through the defence of those trade secrets, the value of which only
increases if the company grows its market share *and* the trade secret
is not compromised. Once a company claims a critical volume of market
share, it becomes ever more difficult to compete with. At this point,
corporate power becomes very dangerous. With the increase in capital
from larger market share, and the power play that comes with it (i.e,
let us buy you; we'll destroy you anyway if you don't), company
acquisitions begin.

Over the last two decades we have seen this pattern run rife in the
technology industry, giving birth to gargantuan monopolies such as
Google, Amazon, Apple and Meta. In the book [*Chokepoint Capitalism*](https://chokepointcapitalism.com/),
Giblin and Doctorow outline how this was in part a result of Robert
Bork's reinvention of antitrust, as put forth in his 1978 book *The
Antitrust Paradox*. The Borkian reinvention of antitrust named
"consumer welfare" as the goal, meaning that, *"so long as prices
went down (or at least, didn't go up), companies more or less stopped
having to worry about antitrust enforcers showing up with subpoenas", [Chokepoint Capitalism](https://chokepointcapitalism.com/). The worst players in Big
Tech make their fortunes with free products (free as in, "free
beer").


In the case of technology companies, proprietary (closed source) software is
the common trade secret. Meta's recommendation algorithm for the news feed is
designed to keep you engaged ([primarily angry or
fearful](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/03/former-facebook-employee-frances-haugen-identifies-herself-as-whistleblower))
for as long as possible. The longer you are kept 'engaged', the more
    advertisements you can be served. Reporting on the harm this has caused is
    abundant with bullying, social division, depression and anxiety being
    [established
    themes](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/social-media-and-mental-health.htm)
    of social impact when it comes to social media.

In 2020, Meta altered its content policies to give lower rankings to content
[they knew promoted damaging behaviours](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/social-media-and-mental-health.htm)
but reversed it after they realised that if they changed the algorithm to be
safer, people would spend less time on the site, click on less ads, and they
(Meta) would make less money. Through actions like this it is evident that
large profit driven corporations may well care a lot for money, and little for
society.

There is a strangeness in considering how a technology that does enable
unparalleled communication abilities for societies, can contort into a
manipulative force that has amounted to such incredible and varied harm to
those societies. But this is not the fault of Mark Zuckerberg himself, or the
employees or Meta as an entity - it is the repercussions of a value for
secrecy, restrictiveness and a technoliberal profit driven attitude towards
society, fueled by a regulatory environment of no real consequence. Meta is set
to receive the largest fine ever handed out for mishandling user information,
but as Johnny Ryan accurately puts it, ["A billion-euro parking ticket is of no
consequence to a company that earns many more billions by parking
illegally"](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/21/facebook-to-be-fined-648m-for-mishandling-user-information).
Fines do not make a real difference.

> "When Richard [Stallman] called it slavery, it wasn't a metaphor. It was
> simply an archaic political term for what it is like living in a world in
> which machines that you can't understand and you can't modify and you can't
> do anything about, control you and everybody else." - Eben Moglen, [Coding Democracy](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262542289/coding-democracy/)

The Facebook user count is approaching three billion. To help this trend
continue, Meta need to (among other things) maintain two critical
assets; the *secrecy* of their algorithms and the restrictiveness of
*interoperability* with their services. This is the game play for any
budding technology company that is yet to come.


We should change that.

## How does the public stand to benefit from FLOSS?

> "We need to rebuild our societies and institutions with a new ethos of
> distributed power. It is our collective responsibility." - Webb, [Coding Democracy](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262542289/coding-democracy/)

Wikipedia heralds this movement in a modern day technology landscape. It has
become a collective treasure, providing free encyclopedic information to those
with means of access (a lot more than the amount who can afford or access
books). It has survived its initial period where accuracy and validity of
information on Wikipedia was in question, and has solidified itself as an
[accepted academic
tool](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4956/Wikipedia-20Stories-of-an-Incomplete-Revolution)
and public good alike, becoming the [7th most accessed website
globally](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1201880/most-visited-websites-worldwide/)
after Google, Youtube, Facebook and some top porn sites (who knew free
education could be so exciting?). Additionally, it finished 2021 with a net
surplus of [$87.6 million USD in
cash](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/1/1e/Wikimedia_Foundation_FY2020-2021_Audit_Report.pdf)
which supports further public good initiatives of the Wikimedia foundation.

It is safe to argue that in this case, CBP (commons-based production)
has proven itself as a benefit to the world community. Society gets free
access to reliable information (a cornerstone for prosperity in general)
without being sold to advertisers, Wikimedia can sustain operations with
a solid financial margin, and the volunteers of Wikipedia can feel pride
in having contributed to a genuine public good.


When secrecy, restrictiveness and focus on profit are brought together, they
create a strong corrupting force. CBP activities such as Wikipedia are counter
to this. [They focus more on a collective effort to achieve a public good and
do so in the absence of market relations and
    hierarchies](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4956/chapter/1879816/From-Utopia-to-Practice-and-Back)
    while also providing positive psychological health benefits
        ([here](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167487012001456),
        [here](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10902-020-00242-8)) (such as
        increase in self worth to those who volunteer.

So where does FLOSS fit in? As well as involving the same flat
hierarchical, volunteer based structure, FLOSS development results in
technology that more often than not has interoperability and respect for
the user's privacy at heart - the antithesis of Big Tech.

Interoperability is a particularly juicy Achilles heel of what Cory
Doctorow and Rebeca Giblin call "chokepoint capitalism", which
illustrates the point of capitalism's narrative that we currently find
ourselves in.

Consider the present day reality of a farmer who needs to do a quick
repair to her tractor. But it is a modern day tractor from colossal
agriculture machinery manufacturer, Jon Deere, so the farmer is "out of
luck". She is barred from doing this repair herself by DRM (Digital
Rights Management) protected software, meaning that even if she knows
how to install the part, she doesn't have the authority to activate it.
Jon Deere charge $230, plus $130 an hour for a technician to drive out
and plug a cable into the tractor to authorize the part
([src](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262542289/coding-democracy/)). This is expensive enough, but what if the
impending hail storm over the horizon arrives before the technician
does, destroying the crop entirely? Chokepoint capitalism is when the
corporations control the buyers, the sellers and the middle people
(mechanics, vendors, etc). They can do this in a large part because they
deliberately deny interoperability with their products, locking all
parties into a system they control.

Luckily for the farmer though, there is a project [dedicated to
circumventing the Jon Deere software locks](https://tractorhacking.github.io/), so her
crop is saved (although she risks a hefty fine for breaking the law by
repairing her tractor, even though she bought it outright). The right to
repair embodies the critical importance of interoperability in that
without it, we are beholden to the company whose product we use. With
interoperability, the companies are beholden to the public. It creates a
need for companies to offer the best service in order to maintain their
customers. It shifts the balance of power back towards the consumer.

The importance of interoperability echos in the [European Union's
regulation](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20220413STO27211/usb-type-c-to-become-eu-s-common-charger-by-end-of-2024)
that by the end of 2024 all manufacturers of small electronic devices must use
USB-C for charging. Additionally consumers must be given the choice to buy a
device with or without a charger. This is interoperability on a hardware level,
but it illustrates the same fundamental point; technologies must work together
and we should be enabled, not restricted, by them --- *especially* if we, the
consumer, being restricted means profit for some person or faceless
corporation.

## A Focus on Communication

As stated at the beginning of this essay; software interfaces with our lives so
frequently, that it becomes harder and harder to distinguish a segregation
between what is, and what is not software driven. There is perhaps no better
example of this, than communication. How we communicate with each other has
undergone rapid and profound change leading us into an era where digital
communication is the preferred method, and messaging over voice a [clear winner
on top](https://ourworldindata.org/rise-of-social-media). Social media lends
itself well to this preference, offering both personal, group and public
communication channels. As such it saw huge adoption, the product coming out on
top being Facebook. But Facebook's end game was not just to offer the best
service to communicate and "be social", that was just the honey trap.

Since the beginning of social media platforms, with Myspace setting the
scene, the value of selling user data to generate advertisement revenue
was clear. Whether or not this was or is the motive from the start is
secondary; the prospect of huge earnings or acquiring power (usually the
two coincide) is a corrupting force. Period.

> "Facebook originally claimed - as an alternative to MySpace - that
> they would never process your data. They later had a referendum, asking
> users if they would be OK to have their data processed (spied on). Users
> said no, Facebook did it anyway." Cory Doctorow [The Changelog, 01:08:00](https://changelog.com/podcast/535) 

This corruption has lead to disastrous consequences, the Cambridge
Analytica scandal taking a sizeable portion of the proverbial cake. What
makes this even worse is of course the fact that users are
algorithmically served up content which is calculated to achieve the
most "engagement", thus keeping them on the platform longer and
producing more data for Facebook to sell. Documentaries such as [*The
Social Dilemma*](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/) as well as whistle
blowers like Frances Haugen and Tristan Harris have helped to hoist up
the optic fiber veil that Big Tech would prefer to leave firmly in
place. Our network effect lock-in (no interoperability for Facebook
users to communicate with Twitter users for example) *and* descent into
social and political chaos, is their profit.


"Just delete your Facebook account" is a common phrase and fundamentally good
advice. Jarod Lannier communicates this with excellent clarity and wit in his
book, [*Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right
Now*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37830765-ten-arguments-for-deleting-your-social-media-accounts-right-now).
But for every one of us who commits and finally does so, there are x young
children signing up for new accounts who have little to no idea about the dark
reality they are stepping into. Simply limping away from this social
catastrophe and dragging a few out with you does not bring lasting change.

## A New Hope

One of the greater public goods that Elon Musk has yet to bring is the
near total destruction of Twitter. His shameful treatment of employees
and other such behaviours spawned a significant movement to
decentralised social media platforms. Mastodon attained the greatest
uptake, seeing a [quarter million people sign up](https://mastodon.online/@mastodonmigration/109368733146867283) on the day Elon Musk's
acquisition of Twitter was settled.

Mastodon is a FLOSS project and implements the W3C's ActivityPub
protocol. What this enables on a functional basis is what centralised
social media platforms like Facebook actively want to restrict. Firstly,
anyone can host a Mastodon "instance", essentially meaning a website
on the internet that other users can create accounts on. *All* users on
*all* instances can interact with each other (i.e, all instances are
interoperable with each other). And secondly, the project is FLOSS and
uses an established internet standard (ActivityPub) that is maintained
by the W3C who are in charge of all the standards that run the web. In
other words, you're free to build your social connections free of
influence from corporations, and to build it on top of an open and
non-profit stack of technologies.

One of the beauties of Mastodon (and any other application built on
ActivityPub), is that if the instance you are registered with, departs
from your values (for example by attracting and supporting content and
people you want no part of), you can simply leave, register with a
different instance and transfer all your friend connections across. Your
friends will not notice any practical difference when interacting with
you. There is no network effect lock-in, no hidden algorithm, no
advertisements.

Furthermore, as Mastodon communicates using the ActivityPub protocol, it
is able to interface with *any other service* that uses ActivityPub,
such as PeerTube (a decentralised video streaming platform), GNU Social
(social networking), Pleroma (microblogging), and many more. With a
technical model like this, services and platforms help each other by
existing within the same ecosystem. Users of one ActivityPub based
service help all others *equally* with every user that signs up. A
community of communities.

## Conclusion

FLOSS is a system of production that has the power not only to create
public goods like a free and academically valid encyclopedia, and social
media without surveillance and calculated manipulation, but to offer
these goods on a collective scale that can upend the power that Big Tech
has over society. Not one app to rule them all, but many apps that work
together to rule over no one.

Collaboration and volunteering are two of the most prominent vertebra in
humanity's collective back bone. It binds communities together, a common
proof is when natural disasters strike. Everyone works together to help
each other, afterwards becoming more tightly knit. It is innate within
us, and we feel good when we do it. It is just that for the last fifteen
years we have been trying to build and maintain communities inside a
Skinner box that invisibly promotes a delicate balance of social and
antisocial.

[FLOSS projects are not impervious to issues](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4956/chapter/1879816/From-Utopia-to-Practice-and-Back)
, but they do begin with a different set of
values. They are built by a community on a volunteer basis. The better
the community, i.e developers, documentation writers, content creators
and users alike, feel about the product or service, the more they will
want to help and the more financial donations they will give or receive;
therein, lightening the workload, reducing the market share of corporate
competition, and supporting the community further. Around and around it
goes. In this space, the community has a collective power. No singular
entity can steer the ship down the river of corruption, moral fraud,
surveillance and manipulation with much certainty. The community will
more than likely dispute it, and if the collective opinion is ignored,
they may well "fork" the project (to clone a copy and develop it
independently of the original, a common process in FLOSS) and continue
with the original plan.

This exact scenario happened in April 2023 where the Rust Foundation,
who guide the increasingly popular and fast growing programming
language, issued a request for comment on a policy change. The policy
change dictated many non-FLOSS values and the Rust community responded
in outrage, which saw a group of users fork the Rust project, renaming
it to Crab (the Rust logo is a cartoon crab). The Rust foundation
received the notice [loud and clear](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/rust-trademark-policy-draft-revision-next-steps/). A similar
event happened in 2022 when the IRC Freenode server [got taken over by a
rogue moderator](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/df80d8d36cd9d1bde46ba018af497409).

As Doctorow's previous quote also shows, Mark Zuckerberg (the main
moderator of Facebook), went rogue quite a while ago. Unfortunately, we
can not fork Facebook:

> "Facebook originally claimed - as an alternative to MySpace - that
> they would never process your data. They later had a referendum, asking
> users if they would be OK to have their data processed (spied on). Users
> said no, Facebook did it anyway." Cory Doctorow [The Changelog, 01:08:00](https://changelog.com/podcast/535) 

FLOSS helps community because it is built, owned and managed by
community; the power is with the people, not a singular person or
corporate entity. This changes the motivations behind technical and
design decisions, making interoperability in particular, a natural
choice. It helps promote social and interpersonal benefits by means of
collaborating with each other for a public good, and can result in tools
that not only function better, respect the fundamental freedoms of users
and remain accessible across the wealth divide, but which can also help
communicate to government and industry what a partial antidote to social
catastrophe can look like.
