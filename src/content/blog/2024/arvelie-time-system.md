I'm currently wrapping my head around Devine's time system,
[Arvelie](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/time) (after also having it
bent by his [time tracking system](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/horaire)).

There are two things I really like about the time system. One, that time ranges
are uniform. Each month has 14 days, which creates 26 months. This makes time
management feel much more approachable. And two, that time for any project or
moment, begins at 0. So Arvelie time is always relative to the artefact which it
is logging.

This creates a different relationship between us and time. As we no longer have
a positional relationship to the past. That is, the past that came before year
"0".

This is mostly how we measure time anyway. How old are you? How long have you
been programming? etc. Except that we additionally reference that against "time
immortal" (which in some domains has the suffixes 'BC' and 'AD').

So you may be 24 years old, having been born in the year 2000. But in Arvelie
time, you would be 24 years old, having been born in the year 0. It creates an
interesting and alternate feeling about the past. It feels more like each birth
(organic, or otherwise - like a project) is its own strand of time, sprouting
from the true "time immortal", which does not have a start date.

While this can sound a bit wishy-washy, I would argue, that this is a lot more
accurate given the context in which we live.

Because we actually measure time in the same style as Arvelie - the universe is
(by our best measure) about 13.8 billion years old. Meaning, that the big bang
was year 0. However, I'm writing this in the year 2024. Or more interestingly,
I'm writing this in the year 2024AD.

This is interesting to me, because the BC / AD attribute, directly communicates
an understanding that time is infinite (or that it moves more like an
oscillation). This is one of the few aspects of religion that I actually like.
That infinity is maintained as a truth, rather than a concept.

Although, granted, this has all too often been used as a weapon (heaven and hell
for eternity). [But we turn all sorts of good things into
weapons](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24120352/israel-lavender-artificial-intelligence-gaza-ai).
