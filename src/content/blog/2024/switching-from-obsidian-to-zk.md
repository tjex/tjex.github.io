If you're an Obsidian user then I'm sorry... Using UIDs sucks because the
autocompletion of links only works by filename, and not by a notes internal
main title... You instead need to do a global search for "# target title", and
drag the result into the pane... This makes linking to a note you know the
title of, a major friction point. Another nisht nisht.

> reasons. But that's a topic for another post...
