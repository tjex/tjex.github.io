Over the past few years I've read through many ideas of how to structure and
organise a Zettelkasten vault. The difficulty of this hangs in the balance
between the need for *some* structure, but the knowledge that too much
structure can severely hinder the effectiveness of a Zettelkasten.

The bitter sweet truth of any Zettelkasten organisational technique is that
you won't know how well it works for you until you spend some time working
with it.

Depending on what structural elements are part of that system can mean a lot
when it comes to changing to a new system. Links can break, tags can get out of
control and features of one program may not be available in another.

This post will explain what I tried, what I kept and what I changed to
eventually bring me to my own iteration, which by sheer fluke could be named
the GRID system (explained below).

## (Over)categorisation is the death of a Zettelkasten

The initial foray into the Zettelkasten technique is uncomfortable. It goes
totally against the grain of how we've been taught through school to take
notes. One notebook per class, divided into semesters / classes / topics / ...

This isn't bad. That style of documentation generally fits the requirements of
that domain, to learn facts and pass exams. And it fits the capabilities of the
students. Keeping up with the onslaught of classes day by day
is plenty.

The 'problem' becomes, that that kind of note taking solidifies as *the* way we record
knowledge for ourselves, and so does the structural thinking that goes behind
it, categorisation. [We're hardwired to
categorise](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wired-for-categorization/),
and we use it for everything, libraries, music, art, ethnicity, psychological
disposition, physical state. An adjective is a categorisation. We categorise to
try and formulate some order to the chaos of reality.

In a Zettelkasten system, information is linked together by a *local* context, meaning
from one note to another, and each note is [atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_atomic).
Trying to categorise for retrieval down the track, quickly leads to over categorisation.

This is why I think starting with the Zettelkasten technique is daunting, and
also why it's hard to find a system that works, because we're so used to the
crutch of categorisation, but categorisation is the antithesis of the
Zettelkasten system.

But the extreme opposite; a singular folder full of all notes, without tags, without titles and
without dates... By definition, there is a balance to be struck, hence the task of finding
a system that works well.

## Brace yourself

First and foremost, I highly recommend to read up a little on Niklas Luhmann's
original Zettelkasten method *before* churning through the swathes of different
approaches within a digital Zettelkasten (this post included).
[Zettelkasten.de](https://www.zettelkasten.de) is undoubtedly the most precious
resource for that. Christian and Sascha [communicate the topic with such
excellence](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/), and the forum there is also
full of great discussion and attitudes.

## A brief review of other systems in the wilderness

Typically, the deliberation of how to give some structure to a Zettelkasten system boils down to
how and in what degree to use:

- tags
- folders
- note titles
- note ids
- naming conventions (e.g., including symbols)
- note metadata (keywords, aliases, author, contextual stimulus, modification date, ...)

The biggest traps for over categorisation are folders and tags.

The formalised systems I've predominantly seen mentioned within Zettelkasten
related forums, videos and posts are [the Jonny Decimal
System](https://johnnydecimal.com/), Tiago Forte's [PARA
system](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/), Nick Milo's [the ACCESS
system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0zWJ-TLghw) and Bryan Jenks' [ADHD
wrangler](https://youtu.be/wB89lJs5A3s?feature=shared&t=1115) (a lot in there...).

I've integrated all of them to considerable degrees except the Jonny Decimal system.

> *we need to decide how to categorise the things that we’re going to store.* ~ Jonny

The amount of categorisation required for the Jonny Decimal system is for me,
not fabulous and most certainly a ['nisht
nisht'](https://youtu.be/LazrAzBP_0I?feature=shared&t=248).

### Folders

The aforementioned systems primarily try to formalise a directory structure for
note storage. Within a Zettelkasten system, folders don't create a major
hurdle, as we can link across folders. This leads many (including my past self) to
make the mistake of building a folder structure, that only ever gets deeper.

As the folder structure gets deeper, we become more invested in it and begin to
rely on it as search tool.

However, the biggest issue with folders is that it creates cognitive friction
during note creation. "Where do I store this note?" should never require
thought or time navigating a directory structure.
This is a design feature of the GRID system.

Jonny Decimal, PARA and ACCESS are based on a categorisation of directories,
but I find the categorisation to miss the mark for various reasons:

- Jonny Decimal is limitless in its folder structure. That's a rabbit hole. *Way*
  too much cognitive friction.
- PARA is designed with project managers in mind. The folder structure is
  incongruous with Zettelkasten principles, e.g., the "Archives" folder. A
  Zettelkasten *is* and archive. A note is never 'inactive', just as a memory
  never is; they're both just resting for a moment.
- ACCESS comes closer to a frictionless solution of folder management, but the
  "Extra" and "Spaces" folder are again rabbits holes.

### Tags

Both Milo and Jenks present the two common and divergent approaches to tagging.

It boils down to tags as [*umbrella terms*, to create loose associations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUq8Pun28FI&t=1222s)
between notes, like 'shared hobbies', or tags as [*statuses*, that 
describe the *state* of a note](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIh1S7ra3aI&t=172s).

The GRID system sits strongly in the tags as *statuses* camp, but leans a
little bit over into the other as well by tagging notes with their information
source.

## The GRID System

Like PARA and ACCESS, GRID is also an acronym for the folder structure. The acronym 
was a total fluke, but I've enjoyed discovering that the acronym also provided 
a soft barrier when considering if I needed another folder or not.

> the GRID-P system, or P-GRID, or GRIPD (as in the 'uncool', and non gamer tag

The folders are: Glossary, Reference, Index, Diary.

### My requirements for a system

To help give context to the system's description below, it will help to understand 
what my requirements were. In other words, what I believe makes for an effective digital
Zettelkasten in specific.

I want my Zettelkasten to be:

1. used for *idea generation* and not a repository for information
   storage and retrieval.
2. as *frictionless as possible* when creating, managing and processing notes.
3. as *future proof* as possible.

*Idea generation* happens when notes are linked together meaningfully and
densely. This allows us to move fluidly through the system, replicating the
process of cognitive thought. With the perfect accuracy of information recall a
computer provides, thinking and ideation become greatly enhanced within a
Zettelkasten, as what we are recalling with perfect accuracy are our own
thoughts. 

As *frictionless as possible* means picking a spot somewhere between order and
chaos. Too much order creates friction. There are too many decisions to consider and 
too often:

> *The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible
> and to follow a few basic principles.* ~ Sönke Ahrens, How To Take Smart Notes.

Chaos occurs when there is too little order, and the system scales beyond a
certain point. There is a time factor involved, which is why it stressed people
out so much when making a design decision for their Zettelkasten system, and
could well be why you're reading this post.

*Future proofing* revolves mostly around technical decisions. As a steadfast principle; 
*never*, *ever* use a note taking program that doesn't let you export your content 
to some strong standard file type such as markdown, text or html.

Each requirement should hopefully become clear by the below explanations of the system. 


## The GRID Folders


### G for glossary

For notes that serve no other purpose than to factually define a thing. Useful 
for using as a jumping off point for a specific thing. 

> "what notes do I have that I've linked to 'the Zeigarnik effect'?"

This helps to avoid cognitive friction. If we can't remember what a certain
thing is, we can quickly refresh our memories within the same system, rather than
opening a browser and breaking our mental context and focus. 

These notes can also serve as mini-indexes if we wish (see indexes below), by
including a small selection of valued notes that relate to the glossary term.

### R for reference

Notes on content we read, watch, hear. Termed 'literature notes' in many discussions. 
The folder is titled 'Reference' to aid in frictionless filing: If we're consuming some 
information and writing notes on it, it goes in the 'Reference' folder, it doesn't matter 
if it's a video, recording, academic paper, etc. 

> This is a good example of where to withhold the temptation to create more folders.
> We could make 'Reference/Papers', 'Reference/Videos', etc. But it's again a rabbit hole. 
> How often have you come across a research publication and tried to determine whether it 
> was a 'paper' or an 'academic journal article'... Poof! There goes your train of thought.
> Not worth it.

There are different styles of making reference notes. [This post](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2002/concrete-example-of-literature-notes) 
shows the common variations (I use 'alternative approach B').

### I for indexes

I consider indexes, Luhmann's [structure notes / hub
notes](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#structure-notes) and Nick Milo's
[MOCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUq8Pun28FI) as fundamentally the same;
they are notes pertaining to a particular topic, with outgoing links to other
notes of value, on that topic. 

As an example, some of my index notes are:

- Cognition
- Meditation
- Programming
- Zettelkasten

### D for diaries

With dates as titles. A place to write down fleeting information or personal 
entries.

### (And the rest of the notes...)

Exist at the root level, from where they may sprout and grow into evergreen
notes.


## Tags

As mentioned, tagging in the GRID system focuses on describing the *status* of a note, with 
a small exception for reference and glossary notes.

Tags must never describe the concept matter of the note. It does not scale and
creates friction when writing notes (thinking about what tags to assign). Instead, tags
communicate either what form the *source* of the information is or what the
*status* of the note is.

### Source tags 

"Through which communication medium was the information received?":

1. *audio:* music, sound recordings 
2. *image:* visual art, photography, graphical content
3. *lit:* literature; book, paper, research, publication, blog post, newsletter
4. *me:* thoughts that arise from 'nowhere'
5. *video:* film, documentary, news reports
6. *vocal:* podcasts, discussions, debates, people, quotes
7. *branch:* sprouted directly from the content of another note.

Notes with a source tag, should therefore *always* have an accompanying
reference entry at the bottom of the note. 

A reference note: 
```markdown
---
...
tags: [lit]
...
---

# Title

Body of the note

---
References:

- url to external source.
```

A 'branched' note:
```markdown
---
...
tags: [branch]
...
---

# Title

Body of the note

---
References:

- [The note that inspired the creation of this note](./note.md)
```

Tags can be combined: 'video' + 'vocal' suggests a video interview, or talk on Youtube.

### Status tags

1. *seed*: all notes start with this. It's a way to easily search for unrefined
   ideas. A note is a *seed* if it has less than 3 [meaningful links](ma31).
2. *fern*: assigned upon removal of the seed tag. 
3. *evergreen*: when a *fern* has 5 or more meaningful links.

I heard this terminology through Bryan Jenks. I like the symbolism.

The status tags are great aids in Zettelkasten maintenance. We can filter our
notes by 'seed' tag, and pick some to work on, iteratively promoting them to
ferns or discovering they already are, and the tag just didn't get updated.

The bi-product of this process is stumbling across old ideas and connecting
them under new context (remember the "Archive" folder in the PARA system?):

> *In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note?
> In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble
> upon it again?* ~ Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes.

### Structure tags

4. *index*: a structure note for a specific topic.
5. *project*: a structure note for a specific project.

The purpose of these tags is purely technical. They are useful for sorting, either 
for retrieval or programmatic processes.


## Note Metadata, File Naming and Future Proofing

### Metadata 

What metadata to use in notes and what file naming convention to implement does come 
down to personal requirements and also what program we're using.

My general recommendation for metadata is in keeping with the principles of 
the GRID system: as frictionless as possible.

This means as little metadata as possible. I have:

```markdown
---
title: note title
date: creation date
id: the file name without extension
tags: [tag, tag]
aliases: e.g., 'AI' (for the note Artificial Intelligence)
---
```
This is already too much for some. But for me it's fine because *no matter what type of note*, 
those metadata fields are applicable.


### File Naming

As hinted at in the above metadata, I use UIDs as file names (4 character
alphanumeric, lower case). This is for a few reasons:

- it reduces the friction of providing a good file name
- the file name never needs to be changed
    - this will prevent link breakage and force you to not use the note's
      filename as natural language in your sentences. For example, this
      \[[sentence]] will become ridiculous if the `sentence.md` is renamed to `chicken.md`.
- links remain small and tidy when viewing in a raw format
- files are super easy to locate and process if needed
- basically everything to do with programmatically working with the
  Zettelkasten via the terminal or scripts becomes way faster and much more
  fail safe

### Future Proofing

The mere fact that the system as it has been described so far
