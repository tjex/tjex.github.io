Over the past few years I've read through many ideas of how to structure and
organise a Zettelkasten vault. The difficulty of this hangs in the balance
between the need for *some* structure, but the knowledge that too much
structure can severely hinder the effectiveness of a Zettelkasten.

The bitter sweet truth of any Zettelkasten organisational technique is that
you won't know how well it works for you until you spend some time working
with it.

Depending on what structural elements are part of that system can mean a lot
when it comes to changing to a new system. Links can break, tags can get out of
control and features of one program may not be available in another.

This post will explain what I tried, what I kept and what I changed to
eventually bring me to my own iteration, which by sheer fluke could be named
the GRID system (explained below).

## (Over)categorisation is the death of a Zettelkasten

The initial foray into the Zettelkasten technique is uncomfortable. It goes
totally against the grain of how we've been taught through school to take
notes. One notebook per class, divided into semesters / classes / topics / ...

This isn't bad. That style of documentation generally fits the requirements of
that domain, to learn facts and pass exams. And it fits the capabilities of the
students. Keeping up with the onslaught of classes day by day
is plenty.

The 'problem' becomes, that that kind of note taking solidifies as *the* way we record
knowledge for ourselves, and so does the structural thinking that goes behind
it, categorisation. [We're hardwired to
categorise](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wired-for-categorization/),
and we use it for everything, libraries, music, art, ethnicity, psychological
disposition, physical state. An adjective is a categorisation. We categorise to
try and formulate some order to the chaos of reality.

In a Zettelkasten system, information is linked together by a *local* context, meaning
from one note to another, and each note is [atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_atomic).
Trying to categorise for retrieval down the track, quickly leads to over categorisation.

This is why I think starting with the Zettelkasten technique is daunting, and
also why it's hard to find a system that works, because we're so used to the
crutch of categorisation, but categorisation is the antithesis of the
Zettelkasten system.

But the extreme opposite; a singular folder full of all notes, without tags, without titles and
without dates... By definition, there is a balance to be struck, hence the task of finding
a system that works well.

## Brace yourself

First and foremost, I highly recommend to read up a little on Niklas Luhmann's
original Zettelkasten method *before* churning through the swathes of different
approaches within a digital Zettelkasten (this post included).
[Zettelkasten.de](https://www.zettelkasten.de) is undoubtedly the most precious
resource for that. Christian and Sascha [communicate the topic with such
excellence](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/), and the forum there is also
full of great discussion and attitudes.

## A brief review of other systems in the wilderness

Typically, the deliberation of how to give some structure to a Zettelkasten system boils down to
how and in what degree to use:

- tags
- folders
- note titles
- note ids
- naming conventions (e.g., including symbols)
- note metadata (keywords, aliases, author, contextual stimulus, modification date, ...)

The biggest traps for over categorisation are folders and tags.

The formalised systems I've predominantly seen mentioned within Zettelkasten
related forums, videos and posts are [the Jonny Decimal
System](https://johnnydecimal.com/), Tiago Forte's [PARA
system](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/), Nick Milo's [the ACCESS
system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0zWJ-TLghw) and Bryan Jenks' [ADHD
wrangler](https://youtu.be/wB89lJs5A3s?feature=shared&t=1115) (a lot in there...).

I've integrated all of them to considerable degrees except the Jonny Decimal system.

The amount of categorisation required for the Jonny Decimal system is for me,
not fabulous and most certainly a ['nisht
nisht'](https://youtu.be/LazrAzBP_0I?feature=shared&t=248).

### Folders

The aforementioned systems primarily try to formalise a directory structure for
note storage. Within a Zettelkasten system, folders don't create a major
hurdle, as we can link across folders. This leads many (including my past self) to
make the mistake of building a folder structure, that only ever gets deeper.

As the folder structure gets deeper, we become more invested in it and begin to
rely on it as search tool.

However, the biggest issue with folders is that it creates cognitive friction
during note creation. "Where do I store this note?" should never require
thought or time navigating a directory structure, it should be immediately
obvious where to put the note, and putting it there should be instantaneous.
This is a design feature of the GRID system.

Jonny Decimal, PARA and ACCESS enforce a categorisation of directories, but in my 
opinion only create opportunity for cognitive friction and difficulty in note 
discovery. 

Problems as I see them: 

- Jonny Decimal is limitless in its folder structure. That's a rabbit hole. WAY
  too much cognitive friction.
- PARA is designed with project managers in mind. The folder structure is
  incongruous with Zettelkasten principles, e.g., the "Archives".
- ACCESS comes closer to a frictionless solution of folder management, but the
  "Extra" and "Spaces" folder are again rabbits holes.

### Tags

Both Milo and Jenks present the two major and divergent approaches to tagging.

It boils down to tags as [*umbrella terms*, to create loose associations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUq8Pun28FI&t=1222s)
between notes, like 'shared hobbies', or tags as [*statuses*, that 
describe the *state* of a note](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIh1S7ra3aI).

The GRID system sits strongly in the tags as *statuses* camp, but leans a little bit 
over into the other as well.

## The GRID System

Nick Milo's [MOCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUq8Pun28FI) are commonly referenced,
which are fundamentally Niklas Luhmann's [structure
notes](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#structure-notes), just dressed up
differently.
