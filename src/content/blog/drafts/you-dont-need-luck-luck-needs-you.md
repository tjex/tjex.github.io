Often someone will describe their success as requiring along the lines of:
determination, and open mind, structure ... and a little luck. Luck is a given.
To the point where it is redundant. You're lucky to even be born in the first
place. Every day we play a game of chance. Forget about something needing to
depend on luck, and instead prepare yourself in the absence of such worry, so
that when you do get an opportunity, that you can sieze it; because luck itself
has nothing to do with your success. It's what you do with it that matters.

But you can 'create' luck; or at least, increase the _chance_ of encountering
it: network, people, be open, kind and get in touch with life and your spirit.
Foster a joy in living. Living at this level promotes an ability to sense
movements in the environment around you.

At the very least, this will create a buffer for when you really do get hit with
some _bad luck_ (health issues, accidents, systemic failures). Creating a
positive outlook on the concept of luck and its role in your life will make the
good luck sweeter and the bad luck less difficult. Ever heard people say in
heindsight "it was a blessing in disguise"? That is an example of being
perceptive of the _fact_ that we're effectively at the mercy of the universe's
complexity. If you try and control that, or demand that it favour you or name
luck as the requirement of your success, it is highly likely that the process of
getting somewhere will be very arduous and the lows will be oh so low.

Examples of bad luck (which doesn't matter really):
