Why am I starting to blog?

- to learn more concretely
- to be more critical of my thoughts
- to hopefully contribute positively to someone else's knowledge
- to make a point to myself, that will otherwise keep mutating in my head
- to support a cultural and societal divergence from centralised social media

And if people actually get to this blog...

- to test my ideas against the chaos of the internet

Let's see...
