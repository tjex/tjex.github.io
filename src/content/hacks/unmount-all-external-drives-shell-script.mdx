Perhaps one of the most annoying reasons to open Finder on mac is to eject hard
drives.

This script allows you to avoid that. It will list all drives to be ejected and
prompt you for confirmation before unmounting them with `diskutil`.

<Callout type="danger">
  If you've renamed your internal HD, you will need to update the variable in
  the script! \ Otherwise you may eject your internal hard drive...
</Callout>

Unmounting is done with `diskutil unmountDisk`, which is safer than `eject`. If
the disk is in use then it will not be ejected.

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash

# change $internalHD if you have changed the default MacOS system HD name
internalHD="Macintosh HD"
filteredVolumes=()
count=0

echo "Disks to eject:"
for v in /Volumes/*; do
    if [[ $v != *"$internalHD" ]]; then
        echo "â€¢ $v"
        filteredVolumes+=("$v")
        count=$((count +1))
    fi
done

if [[ $count == "0" ]]; then
    echo "No disks to eject"
    exit
fi

echo ${disks[*]}

read -p 'Eject ALL the above disks? (Y/N): ' confirm
if [[ $confirm == [yY] || $confirm == [yY][eE][sS] ]]; then
    for v in ${filteredVolumes[*]}; do
        echo "Ejecting $v..."
        diskutil unmountDisk $v
    done
else
    echo 'cancelled'
fi

```
