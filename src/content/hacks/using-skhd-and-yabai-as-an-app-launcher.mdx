## Intro

One of the things I miss the most from my brief two month usage of GNU/Linux was
the hackable, performant and joyfully simple selection of launchers available
(e.g. dmenu, rofi, wofi, etc).

I'm yet to find anything that operates the same on mac. There is
[dmenu-mac](https://github.com/oNaiPs/dmenu-mac) but for this particular use
case, I couldn't get it to play nice.

So I looked to try hack together a solution from tools I already used. This lead
me to using [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) and
[yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) as a 'launcher' of sorts. In this
case, we'll be setting up a keybind to bring up a terminal with
[gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) already running. You can substitute
any other program with gopass. If you can run it from the terminal, you can run
it via skhd.

For example, I have keybindst to brung up [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf),
english dictionary and my web browser.

## Configs

### skhd

The keybind comes first. skhd needs to launch a terminal instance and execute
`gopass`. As I'm using [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) (the best
terminal emulator under the sun), the entry in `~/.config/skhd/skhdrc` looks
like:

```bash
alt + cmd - g : /Applications/WezTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/wezterm start zsh -l -c gopass
```

<Callout type="note">
  If you use a different terminal emulator, replace the app path with the
  appropriate path change.
</Callout>

Now we can hold down `alt` - `cmd` and press `g` to spawn a terminal instance
with gopass running.

The full application is needed as otherwise skhd will launch a new instance of
the terminal emulator, rather than using the already running process.

Some extra detail on the command:

- `cli start` is
  [specific to wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/cli/start.html?h=start).
- `zsh -l` starts the spawned terminal process as a login shell, which loads our
  environment variables (important for gopass as it needs to know gpg
  directories as well as the $PASSWORD_STORE_DIR).
- `-c <command>` takes the first argument as a command to execute
  ([zsh docs](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Invocation.html#Invocation)).

<Callout type="note">
  In the case of a command with arguments, the entire call needs to be wrapped
  in quotes. This is because of how `-c` works. ```bash ... cli spawn
  --new-window zsh -l -c "bkmr search --fzf" ```
</Callout>

### yabai

yabai is built by the same developer and brings tiling window management to
MacOS (the other major contender being
[Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst). With yabai we can also define
rules for window management, which is how we'll manage to get a new terminal
instance running gopass to appear as a floating window in the center of the
screen without altering the layout of our currently tiled windows.

Currently, the spawned terminal will be tiled as per the default rules of yabai.
But it's nicer to have it pop up in the center of the screen (i.e. like a
launcher would). To do this we define a
[rule](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/blob/master/doc/yabai.asciidoc#rule).

In `~/.config/yabai/yabairc`:

```bash
yabai -m rule --add app="^WezTerm$" title="^gopass$" manage=off grid=3:3:1:1:1:1

```

This informs yabai that when it encounters a window from WezTerm with the window
title "gopass", that it should _not_ manage it (meaning don't apply tiling
rules) - however, we then apply our _own_ tiling rules. The combination of these
two ideas (don't auto tile, but apply our own tiling) effectively means we can
place a floating window where we please.

It is therefore important you take note of how your terminal emulator titles
your windows. Typically, the default is to name it either as the current working
directory, or the running process.

The `grid` sytax is as follows:
`grid=<rows>:<cols>:<start-x>:<start-y>:<width>:<height>`

Broken down further:

- `<rows>:<cols>` is how many divisions make up your custom grid. e.g. `3:3`
  gives you space for 9 windows.
- `<start-x>:<start-y>` is which tile on the x axis and which on the y should
  the window be placed.
- `<width>:<height>` defines how many tiles the window should span in x and y.

<Callout type="note">
  The above dot points are as best I understand from the documentation. However,
  as you see from the screenshot below, the columns / rows are not evenly sized.
  So I'm not sure exactly what detail I'm missing there... But, it works...
</Callout>

Now when we execute the keybind, we get a floating window in the center which
runs gopass.
