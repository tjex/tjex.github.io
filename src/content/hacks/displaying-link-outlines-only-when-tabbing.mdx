You may know the
[`:focus` psudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus),
which is applied when a user focusses on whichever element you've extended with
`:focus`. It's commonly used with links, where an outline is drawn around the
focussed link with `outline: <style>` and is a very important usability feature
for people who navigate webpages other than with a mouse.

However, when clicking on a link via the mouse, the same display changes applied
under `:focus` will flash. This is not so pleasing, and is unnecessary. If a
mouse is being used to click on the link, we don't need to see elements of
`:focus`.

For example, the following will display a dashed outline around a link as well
as a colored background. When clicking on the link we will see those elements
flash on click.

```css
a:focus {
  background-color: var(--focus-color);
  outline: dashed;
  outline-width: 2px;
  outline-offset: 4px;
}
```

But since 2022 the
[`:focus-visible` css psudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible)
is supported as standard.

> This selector is useful to provide a different focus indicator based on the
> user's input modality (mouse vs. keyboard) ~
> [mdn docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible)

This means that our page can stay accessible for those who need or want it,
while mouse users don't need to see flashes of UI on each click.

```css
a:focus-visible {
  background-color: var(--focus-color);
  outline: dashed;
  outline-width: 2px;
  outline-offset: 4px;
}
```
