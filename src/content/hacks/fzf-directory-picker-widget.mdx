[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is of course one of the best tools around. 

Out of the box it offers:

- file and directory search
- history search
- "auto `cd`" (search for a directory and cd into it on selection)

I would say 80% of the time I use `fzf` to pick files, and therefore have my 
`$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` set to only find files.

```zsh
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd -H -tf'
```

This then means that I can't use the `CTRL-T` keybinding to find directories.

I dug into the `zsh` functions that come with `fzf` to replicate the same file picking 
behaviour, but for directories. It get's exported as a widget, which you can then 
use to bind to a keybind of your choice.

In your `.zshrc`:

```zsh
# use fzf to search for dirs and paste them inplace, in the current prompt
fzf_dir() {
    cmd=$(fd . --type d | fzf --preview 'tree -C {} | head -200')
    LBUFFER="${LBUFFER}${(q)cmd}"
    local ret=$?
    zle reset-prompt
    return $ret
}

# export the function as a widget
zle -N fzf_dir

# assign the widget to a keybind
bindkey '^d' fzf_dir # set in ./functions
```

## Magic

The magic is happening in `LBUFFER="${LBUFFER}${(q)cmd}"`

The `(q)` in `${(q)cmd}`, quotes the resulting expanded variable (`cmd`). In other words, wraps 
it in quotation marks. This allows file paths with spaces to be interpreted correctly by the shell.

`LBUFFER` is the contents to the left of the cursor. By setting itself to itself, appended with the 
expansion of `${(q)cmd}`, we are left with the prompt as we had it before, appended by the chosen 
directory from `fzf`.
