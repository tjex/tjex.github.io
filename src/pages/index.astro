  <h1>hello</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a programmer interested in decentralisation and commons-based
    production principals as an effective antidote to social and technological
    problems. In my lifetime I would like to see a less surveillance and profit
    driven world emerge - or at least enough coverage throughout the world to
    make a tangible difference. Currently I'm finishing my masters degree in
    Creative Technologies / Computer Science between Berlin and Stockholm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before a focus on programming, I was working in the arts / music industry as
    a <a rel="me" href="https://tillmanjex.bandcamp.com/music"
      >producer of story music</a
    > and sound engineer. I was also the head engineer of
    <a href="https://www.monomsound.com/">MONOM</a>, a spatial audio studio in
    Berlin, which saw my two loves of music and tech come together and
    insighted me to focus on programming and tech more seriously.
  </p>
  <p>
    My creative pursuits and the experiences it has lead me through influence 
    my technical work and way of thinking. I try to foster that  
    in my writing, which has so far only been taking place privately, but which 
    will gradually start to materialise on this site. <br>
