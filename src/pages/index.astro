      If you haven't heard about <a
        href="https://astro.build"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro</a
      > yet you're missing out. This starter repo gives you a blog website with posts
      written in Markdown, all powered by Astro.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't be fooled by the simplicity of this starter either. With excellent
      SEO built in, Astro's excellent developer environment, and performance
      best practices you're getting one of the best foundations for a personal
      blog with posts written in markdown. The reason for making such a bare
      bones starter in terms of styles is that it has what you need out of the
      box for SEO and site structure but it makes no assumptions about how you
      want it look and behave.

    <p>
      Sometimes starters can feel like they are giving us way too much and
      you'll spend a day picking apart half of the code to get to the setup you
      actually wanted. Want to use vanilla CSS instead of Tailwind or Scss? No
      problem!
