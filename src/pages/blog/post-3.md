## What is wrong?

Technology moves fast, and increasingly so. It interfaces with our lives so
frequently, that it becomes harder and harder to distinguish a segregation
between what is software driven and what is not. Even organising a "digital
detox" getaway involves an entire infrastructure of software and technology,
from booking the retreat, to paying for the train tickets, to then navigating
your way from the station to the retreat and possibly messaging some extra
friends along the way that you won't be contactable during the stay. On a
larger scale, there are countries where it is almost impossible to pay by any
means other than digital, leading to some awkward silences when the system breaks.

So what is wrong with this on a larger scale? The issue is that technology has
moved so fast, that it is blind sided governments and regulators who due to
arduous bureaucratic process are condemned to moving slow to begin with. As a
result, we've seen a free market techno libertarianism environment emerge since
the 1990s that *appears* to be utopic, but which is actually dealing a multitude
of harms.

This essay focuses on the harm that has occurred to our sense of community. It discusses 
some of the reasons why this has happened, but more critically how it has been 
is enabled by an absence of Free/Libre and Open Source Software
(FLOSS) principals combined with unregulated corporate practices. 

## What is FLOSS?

To understand the problem and solution properly, it is worth taking a moment to
briefly touch on the unfortunately problematic terminology surrounding software
development philosophies. 

Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) is the combination of two longer standing
terminologies. "Free software" was coined by Richard Stallman in the early 80s
after the initial hacker culture of MIT splintered, some departing to the path
to proprietary software\cite{coding democracy}. The term "free software"
however has lead to a confusion of meaning that is still ongoing to this day
leading people to interpret the term to mean software that doesn't cost money
to use. Stallman aims to clear up the confusion as such, 
> "When we call software “free,” we mean that it respects the users' essential
> freedoms: the freedom to run it, to study and change it, and to redistribute
> copies with or without changes. This is a matter of freedom, not price, so
> think of “free speech,” not “free beer.”"\cite{GNU Project post}

"Open source" on the other hand stands for criteria a littler looser than free
software. Like free software, the source code still needs to be available for
any who wish to inspect it, but where it departs is the restrictiveness of some
open source licenses and the divergent philosophy this brings to the production
of software \cite{GNU project post}. 

FLOSS appends "Libre" (French and Spanish for "free" in the sense of freedom) to
the "free software" idiom in order to make clearer the true meaning of the
philosophy. It therefore offers a neutrality between the two and allows us to
focus more so on both camps working together to balance out the alternative to
FLOSS, which is a far greater good.


## What is the alternative to FLOSS?

The success of any corporation against its competitors can often rest significantly 
on the strength of secrecy behind trade secrets. The recipe behind Coca-cola is an 
endearing example, as is the formula for the WD-40 multi-use lubricant and the 
algorithms behind Google search or song recommendations on Spotify. 

With trade secrets, companies exert competitive advantage on each other through the 
defence of those trade secrets, the value of which only increases if the 
company grows its market share *and* the trade secret is not compromised. Once a 
company claims a critical volume of market share, it becomes ever more difficult 
to compete with. It's at this point where corporate power becomes very dangerous. 
With the increase in capital from increased market share as well as the bargaining 
power that comes with it, company acquisitions begin. 

Over the last two decades we have seen this pattern run rife in the technology
industry, giving birth to gargantuan monopolies such as the Google, Amazon,
Apple and Meta. In the book *Chokepoint Capitalism*, Giblin and Doctorow 
outline how this was in part a result of Robert Bork's reinvention of antitrust, 
as put forth in his 1978 book *The Antitrust Paradox*. The Borkian reinvention of 
antitrust named "consumer welfare" as the goal, meaning that, "so long as prices 
went down (or at least, didn't go up), companies more or less stopped having to
worry about antitrust enforcers showing up with subpoenas" \cite{chokepoint 
capitalism p.10}.

In the case of technology companies, proprietary (closed source) software is
the common trade secret. Meta's recommendation algorithm for the news feed is 
designed to keep you engaged (primarily angry or fearful \cite{guardian, profit before 
public good}) for as long as possible. The longer you are scrolling, 
the more advertisements you can be served, and the more data they get about you and 
your preferences, allowing for further optimisation of the algorithm. Reporting 
on the damage this has caused is abundant. What is less clear, is what techniques 
do we currently have that can help us break out of this walled garden?


## How do we stand to benefit from FLOSS?

For this to 
continue, Meta need to maintain two critical assets; the secrecy of their algorithms 
and the restrictiveness of interoperability with their services. With this, the 
garden walls stay very strong; 3billion users in, all competitors out.
